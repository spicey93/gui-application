- Always try to keep it as simple as possible.
- Avoid repeating yourself with code and refactor when files start to get too large.
- Make sure we have tests in place for core features and systems so we avoid breaking anything.
- Model, view, controller file structure.
- Always try to build in a way that is modular and scalable.
- Try to keep code tidy and organised.
- Move utility scripts into the scripts directory to keep the main directory clean
- Keep the application lightweight
- Aim for a clean, simple ui layout
- Test driven development
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use context managers (with statements) for database connections to ensure proper cleanup
- Never expose raw exception messages to users - show user-friendly error messages instead
- Use Qt signals and slots for communication between components (never direct method calls across MVC boundaries)
- Keep views focused on UI only - all business logic belongs in controllers
- Validate user input in controllers, not just in views
- Use constants or config files for magic numbers and repeated strings
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add docstrings to all public methods and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use logging instead of print statements for debugging and error tracking
- Whenever we get bugs or errors, we should put tests in place to ensure they don't occur again. We should also consider if any other similar bugs could exist and write tests for those and then run them to see if the application is working properly.
- I don't want any files longer than 300 lines of code. At that point, refactor and modularise the code.
- If there is duplicate code on different files, consider using classes or some other method to reduce repetition of code.
- Whenever we add a keyboard shortcut, append that shortcut to the button, label or widget that uses that shortcut.
