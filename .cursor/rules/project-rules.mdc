- Always try to keep it as simple as possible.
- Avoid repeating yourself with code and refactor when files start to get too large.
- Make sure we have tests in place for core features and systems so we avoid breaking anything.
- Model, view, controller file structure.
- Always try to build in a way that is modular and scalable.
- Try to keep code tidy and organised.
- Move utility scripts into the scripts directory to keep the main directory clean
- Keep the application lightweight
- Aim for a clean, simple ui layout
- Test driven development
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use context managers (with statements) for database connections to ensure proper cleanup
- Never expose raw exception messages to users - show user-friendly error messages instead
- Use Qt signals and slots for communication between components (never direct method calls across MVC boundaries)
- Keep views focused on UI only - all business logic belongs in controllers
- Validate user input in controllers, not just in views
- Use constants or config files for magic numbers and repeated strings
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Add docstrings to all public methods and classes
